<h3>FAQ</h3>
<br>

<b>What sorts of projects does the URG work on?</b><br>
<p>Our focus has been on papers relating to education, particularly in math and computer science. 
 Partially because it tends to be work that students can understand and relate to, and 
 partially because that’s Brian’s area of interest.</p>
 
<b>What is the time commitment like?</b><br>
<p>Entirely up to you. Some people show up for one or two meetings and just listen in, some people volunteer to 
 present papers at the reading group, some people go on to work on projects and spend months developing them.</p>


<b>What do I get out of it?</b><br>
<p>You get to learn about research, develop your skills, and hang out with some cool people talking about interesting ideas.</p>


<b>But like… what do I get out of it?</b><br>
<p>There are no marks to be gained or money to be made in the URG. 
Some students wind up on projects that turn into D94/D95 project courses, 
and some students wind up co-authoring papers, and getting to go and travel to conferences to present their work.</p>

<b>What qualifications do I need to join the group?</b><br>
<p>You need to be a student at UTSC (and even that is somewhat flexible as we’ve had recent grads work with us). 
 Aside from that, just an interest in research and a desire to learn. All are welcome.</p>

<b>What if I can’t make it to the reading group?</b><br>
<p>No problem. There will be other opportunities to get involved. 
 Just join the mailing list and we’ll keep you informed.</p>
